## 4. Reflection on Challenges

### Infrastructure as Code Challenges
- *Azure Provider Learning*: Acess  Azure Terraform providers was not easy as and it  required understanding different resource structures
- *Resource Dependencies*: Managing the correct order of resource creation, especially with networking and database connections was that easy 
- *Terraform State*: Understanding how to properly manage Terraform state for team collaboration

### Manual Deployment Process
- *Container Registry Setup*: Initially struggled with ACR authentication and permissions
- *App Service Configuration*: Learning to properly configure environment variables and container settings
- *Database Connectivity*: Ensuring the App Service could connect to PostgreSQL with proper firewall rules
